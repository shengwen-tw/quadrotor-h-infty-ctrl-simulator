# Quadrotor H∞ Control Simulator

H∞ Control is a robust control algorithm minimizes the transfer function gain with disturbance as performance index.
It requires level of  mathematical knowledge to understand the theory compared to other control algorithms.

The project provides a design example for the quadrotor without relying on external packages. All of the code are written in MATLAB.
